# imac2008
Extra software to run on our Xubuntu Linux installtion of 2008 iMacs

This script was created to resolve some issues with 2008 iMac (all-in-one) computers running Xubuntu, and to get some Mac-like software on the iMacs.

One of the issues on the 2008 iMacs is that if you select the bcmwl-kernel-source wifi driver from the graphical drivers program, wifi will connect, but not
resolve. Uncheck/remove this driver and run this script to install the b43 driver.
